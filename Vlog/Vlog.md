# Vlog

**Chapter I**

Vlog wasn't my first choice, actually. I was more into photography. But the reason why we started filming vlogs was that there were exciting moments which one photo could show only a second of, rather than capture them all.

> 实际上，vlog并不是我的第一选择。我更喜欢摄影。但是我们开始拍摄vlog的原因是，有一些激动人心的时刻，照片只能显示当时的那一片刻，而不是捕捉全部。

Although we could take amazing photos, when we showed them to our friends and family, they would say something like: "I really want to see more. Do you have a video of this?" That's the first reason we started vlogging - to capture more exciting stuff on our travels and share it with other people.

> 虽然我们可以拍一些很棒的照片，当我们把它们展示给我们的朋友和家人时，他们会说：“我真的想看更多。”你有这方面的视频吗？”这是我开始vlogging的第一个原因——在我们的旅行中捕捉更多令人兴奋的东西，并与他人分享。

The second reason is that it is another way to remember our travels. There are many places we might just visit once in our whole lives, and we need something besides photos to remind us of it. The more we travel, the more we realize we need to start filming something.

> 第二个原因是，这是记住我们旅行的另外一种方式。在我们的一生中，有很多地方我们可能只去一次，除了照片之外，我们还需要一些别的东西来帮助我们回忆。我们走的地方越多，需要把一些东西用视频的形式拍下来的愿望就越强烈。\

**Chapter II**

"Vlogging" was a good "excuse" for me to explain why I started talking directly to the camera and sharing video online. Of course, vlogging is a great way to document daily life and express myself but, without such an excuse, such behavior could barely be justified for someone who's in his thirties, I guess.

> “Vlogging”对我来说是一个很好的“借口”，它让我直接对着摄像头说话，并在网上分享视频。当然，vlogging是一种记录日常生活和表达自我的好方法，但是，如果没有Vlogging的话，这样的行为对于30多岁的人来说有点不靠谱。

After I started vlogging, a lot of people started following me and interacting with me. Today's vlogs are more cinematic than video a decade ago. Vloggers apply film editing and storytelling skills they have learned from film industry to their online videos.

> 在我开始使用vlogging之后，很多人开始一起跟随着我并与我互动。今天的Vlogs比十年前的视频更有电影效果。vlogger把从电影里面学到的电影剪辑手法和故事讲述的技巧运用到他们的在线视频中。

I think vlog has already become a trend. People are joining the trend but it is still at a very early stage.

> 我认为vlog已经成为一种趋势。人们正在成为这个趋势中的一份子，但Vlog仍处于初级阶段。
