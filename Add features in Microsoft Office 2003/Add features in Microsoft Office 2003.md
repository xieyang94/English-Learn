# Add features in Microsoft Office 2003

Leo：Tony, do you have a second? I have a question.

Tony：Sure, what's that?

Leo：I use Microsoft Excel quite a lot in my work, you know.I thought I was familiar with the program.But I found the other day that one of the guys beside me was using an Excel template I'd never known.It is a sales invoice（销售发票） or something.But I cannot find it back on my own computer.I am so confused.Is there anything wrong with my Office programs?

Tony：Oh, I know what you mean.No, there is nothing wrong with your Office.In fact, you can get extra templates in many ways, such as downloading them from online resources websites or from the Office installation CD.

Leo：The CD ? I have got the CD !

Tony：Yes. For example, as to（至于，就像） the sales invoice template you mentioned, it is already on the installation CD, and what you need to do is just to add the feature to your Excel.

Leo：The CD has been in my drawer（抽屉） all the time ! Tony, tell me how to add the feature, would you ?

Tony：OK.First find Microsoft Office 2003 in the Add or Remove Programs list and click Change.Then select Add or Remove Features in the Setup dialogue box.Click and select Choose advanced customization of applications, and select the components that you want to install in the next window.In your case, you need to select Spreadsheet templates under the component of Microsoft Office Excel, choosing Run from My Computer.At last, click Update to finish the whole process.

Leo：So I can add any other features any time I want in the future.

Tony：Yes,as long as it is on the CD.

Leo：Thank you,Tony

Tony：That's alright.
