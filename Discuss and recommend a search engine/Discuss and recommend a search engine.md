# Discuss and recommend a search engine

Leo： Tony， may I ask you a question? Which domestic(国内) search engine is the best?

Tony： Oh,I think Baidu is the best one in China， very convenient(方便) and fast too. And not only can you search for news on it， but also for MP3 files and lyrics.

Leo： You know , i often need to search for some information on the Internet at work. I've tried some other search engines before, but didn't feel good about them. I often couldn't find what I needed.

Tony： Which search engines have you used before?

Leo： I've tried Sohu's search engine, and Sina's too.

Tony： Well, those two have become web portals(门户) now. The are not specialized(专门) in search engine business, so they are not the best choice.

Leo： Oh, that sounds reasonable.

Tony： Why not try Google? That is the best of all, and it' s easy to search for information in both Chinese and English. And actually,Google supports over 100 languages throughout the world.

Leo： Pardon me, what did you call it?

Tony： Google， G-O-O-G-L-E.

Leo： Strange(奇怪) name ! Why is it called Google?

Tony： Well, it was from the word GooGol(天文数字； 指的是10的100次幂), which has the same pronunciation(发音) and the similar spelling. GooGol is the large number 10^100, that is, I followed by one hundred zeros. The company chose this name for their search engine to indicate(表明) that users could find tons  of information through Google.

Leo： That's interesting ! I will try it out !
