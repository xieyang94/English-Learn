# Discuss and recommend a search engine

Leo： Tony， may I ask you a question？ Which domestic search engine is
the best？
Tony： Oh，I think Baidu is the best one in China， very convenient and
fast too。 And not only can
you search for news on it， but also for MP3 files and lyrics
Leo： You know ，i often need to search for some information on the
Internet at work。 I've tried
some other search engines before， but didn’t feel good about them.I often couldn’t find what I needed.
Tony： Which search engines have you used before？
Leo： I' ve tried Sohu's search engine， and Sina’s too
Tony： Well， those two have become web portals now。 The are not
specialized in search engine business， so they are not the best choice。
Leo： Oh， that sounds reasonable
Tony： Why not try Google？ That is the best of all， and it' s easy to
search for information in both
Chinese and English。 And actually， Google supports over 100 languages
throughout the
world
Leo： Pardon me， what did you call it？
Tony： Google， G-0-0-G-L-E
Leo： Strange name！ Why is it called Google？
Tony:Well， it was from the word googol， which has the same 
pronunciation and the similar
spelling。 Googol is the large number 10^100， that is,I
followed by one hundred zeros.The company chose this name for their search engine to indicate that
users could find tons  of information through Google.

Leo:That’s interesting ! I will try it out!
