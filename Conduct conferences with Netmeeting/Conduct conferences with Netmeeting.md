# Conduct conferences with Netmeeting

Tony：I am planning to hold a video conference with my colleagues by Netmeeting. Can you tell me how to do it?

Leo：First, make sure that the webcam and the microphone are connected to your computer correctly. And then run the Netmeeting program.

Tony：Where can I find it ?

Leo：There are usually two ways to find it. One is to locate the program in the folder where it is installed. And it is usually in the Program Files folder on drive C. And then double click conf. exe to start it. The other way is to click Run on Start menu, input conf in the Open dialogue box and press the Enter key. You also need several simple steps to finish the configuration, like entering your user information.

Tony：So I can start the video conference now?

Leo：Not yet. You need to host a meeting first. Select host meeting on the Call menu, and specify the name of the meeting

Tony：Oh, then how can I let my colleagues join in the meeting

Leo：You need to tell them your IP address and they can call you at your IP address. You will see a dialogue box of an incoming call. Click Accept to allow them to Join in.

Tony：Then all I need to do is to accept the call?

Leo：Yes. Furthermore, you can also allow your colleagues to see what you are presenting on your desktop.

Tony：What can I do to let them see it ?

Leo：You can choose Share on the Tools menu, and then select your Desktop or the program you want to share with others.

Tony：I got it. Thank you very much for your help.

Leo：You are welcome.
