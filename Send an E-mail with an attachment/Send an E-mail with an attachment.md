# Send an E-mail with an attachment

Leo：Are you busy now ? I have got a question to ask you.

Tony：Not really, What's up ?

Leo：I am using Microsoft Outlook 2003 to send my colleague an email with an attachment . but it won't work .

Tony：Is your attachment very large ? There is usually an attachment size limit.

Leo：I don t think so . The size of the attachment is only 1.4MB

Tony：Then what is the type of the attached file ? There are security risks in certain files , such as the files with the filename extensions of .asp, .exe,.reg, etc. In such cases , Microsoft Outlook 2003 will prohibit the e-mails by default when you send them

Leo：Why does Microsoft Outlook 2003 block them ?

Tony：Because the files with such extensions may contain viruses which will harm your computer .

Leo：I see . Then extension of my attachment is .exe. That’s why it can not be sent . Then how can I send the attachment to my colleague ?

Tony：There are usually two ways to solve the problem . One is to change the extension , and tell you colleague to change it back to .exe before opening the attachment ; the other is to compress the attachment with WinRAR or other programs , and you can send it to your colleague then.

Leo：thank you so much for helping me out. Tony

Tony：Anytime.
