# Hare folders and files in windows xp

Leo： Tony, is there any way to allow others on a network to access(访问) the resources in my computer ?

Tony： Yes, there is a simple way. You can share the files or folders with other users on the network.

Leo： So what shall i do ?

Tony： First, you should disable(禁用) the default Simple File Sharing. On the View tab in the Folder Options dialogue box, deselect(取消) Use simple file sharing in the Advanced(高级) Settings area.

Leo： OK, it is done.

Tony： Second, right-click on the folder you want to share and select Sharing and Security. On the sharing tab, select Share this folder, At last, click Apply.

Leo： How can others access my shared folder？

Tony： Others can do this by searching for your computer by your computer name or IP address, And besides, to allow others to access your computer, you should turn on the Guest account(来宾帐户).

Leo： It is so helpful. Thank you, Tony.

Tony： You are welcome.
