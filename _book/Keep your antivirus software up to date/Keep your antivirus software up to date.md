# Keep your antivirus software up to date

Leo : Hi , Tony , yesterday I read a magazine named PC Fans

Tony : It ' s pretty good . Anything new?

Leo : Yes . There is an article about viruses . It lists a few primary indicators that your computer might be infected by viruses .

Tony : Oh? What are they?

Leo : Well perhaps these are the signs of viruses :

1 . Your computer runs much slower than it usually does

2 . Your computer stops responding or locks up often

3 . Your computer crashes , restarts on its

4 . Applications on your computer don't work correctly

5 . Disk drives are inaccessible

Tony : These are common signs of infection - but they might also indicate hardware or software problems that have nothing to do with a virus.

Leo : Does it mean my computer is in danger all the time

Tony : You needn’t have to worry about it too much . Antivirus software programs can help protect your computer from viruses. However , Microsoft Windows does not come with any antivirus software. You must purchase and install one separately.

Leo: Oh, I see, if my computer is infected by a virus,how should i remove it?

Tony:Firstly you ought to visit Microsoft Update and install the latest updates. Then if you are current using antivirus software , visit the manufacturer’s website , update your software , and then perform a thorough scan of your computer . If not , subscribe services and software and scan your computer immediately .

Leo : I got it . Thanks a lot
