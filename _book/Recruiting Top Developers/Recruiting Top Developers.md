# Recruiting Top Developers

The company used its own software to hire a Rails programmer in a most unconventional way . Here the story .

Jason didn’t quite fit the typical profile for a programmer He didn't go to college . He taught himself programming because he needed a website for a custom T-shirts company he had started. But he was obsessed with programming and contributed a lot to GitHub . He was living off credit card debt when he received an email offering interview opportunity as a programmer at a San Francisco startup called Gild.
