# Dialogue one

M： Can you have the briefs from the Anderson firm's lawyer on my desk by tomorrow morning. There are quite a lot very time sensitive matters with this case. I'm afraid I can't wait any longer.

F： Getting those Anderson briefs has been harder than you can imagine. I have tried to contact their lawyer many times. But every time I call, His secretary says he's in a meeting or out of the office or away on business. I am beginning to think he is trying to avoid me.

M： That's highly possible.  He knows if we miss our filing deadline, we don't stand a chance to compete against them for the bid. Try to get a hold of him again. Give him a call and see if he can fax them first thing.

F： What if I can't speak to him directly ?

M： Ask his secretary to fax them. It's the same thing. Have them faxed over with a copy also faxed to Martin's office

F： How do I find Martin's fax number ? Is he in your roller desk

M： No, but you can also call their office and ask the secretary to give you their fax number. I'll email you their office number later today.

F： OK,I'll get on it first thing.

M： Be sure you do. I need those bets ASAP
