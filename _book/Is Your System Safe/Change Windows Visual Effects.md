# Change Windows Visual Effects

Leo：Tony,I have a question.

Tony：What's up, Leo?

Leo：I have been using my computer for a while.It has been running much slower since I installed some application software.What can I do to get it faster?

Tony：If all the programs are necessary, you can then solve the problem by giving up some visual effects of the system.

Leo：What exactly should I do about that?

Tony：What you need to do is to adjust the system for its best performance instead of best appearance.You can just right-click My Computer and select Properties.On the Advanced tab, click the Settings button under Performance.Are you with me ?

Leo：Yes, go on please?

Tony：OK.On the Visual Effects tab, you can make your choice.For example, select the Adjust for best performance radio button and all the special visual effects will be disabled but the system can run faster as you expected.

Leo：That's cool.Thank you.But wait, how can I remove the background of the desktop icon labels?

Tony：Oh, right.Just select the check box of use drop shadows for icon labels on the desktop in that dialogue box.

Leo：Problem solved.Thank you very much, Tony
