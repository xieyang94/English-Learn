# Add a New E-mail Account in Microsoft Outlook

Leo：Tony,could you tell me how to receive e-mails on my own computer?It takes too much time to check e-mails on the web site, since I do it quite often.

Tony：You don't have to log on to the web site every time. You can receive your e-mails with Microsoft Outlook.

Leo：Can you tell me how to do that?I have no clue at all.

Tony：After running Outlook, you can first click E-mail Account on the Tools menu.And then select Add a new e-mail account.

Leo：I see.What type of e-mail server should I choose ?

Tony：In this case.you need to choose POP3, And on the next page, in the appropriate boxes, you need to type the information our administrator gave you, such as your e-mail address, user name, password, and the POP3 and SMTP addresses.

Leo：I got it.But one more question, do I have to type the password every time I check my messages?

Tony：No, you don't. You can type it in the Password box and select the Remember password check box. In this way, you can have Outlook remember your password and you don't have to type it in next time you check your e-mails.

Leo：That's very helpful.Thank you very much, Tony.

Tony：You're welcome! Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions.

Leo：I won't.Thank you.
