# Zero-day Attack

Last year Google revealed Project Zero , an elite team of top hackers. The team aims to improve security and protect the internet from zero-day vulnerabilities. It has already uncovered a number of zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows and Apple Mac OS X

But what exactly does zero-day mean Before we dig into the meaning of zero- day, it is important to understand the difference between vulnerabilities and exploit.

- revealed：透露、表明、展示、发布
- elite：精英
- aim to：目的是
- zero-day：零日攻击
- vulnerabilities：漏洞
- uncovered：揭示、裸露
- exploit：恶意攻击程序、利用

> Exploit 的英文意思就是利用，它在黑客眼里就是漏洞利用。有漏洞不一定就有Exploit（利用)，有Exploit就肯定有漏洞。
