# PowerPoint packaging

Tony： What's up, Leo ? You look so depressed.

Leo： What should I do ? There is no Microsoft Office installed on the computer in our meeting 22 room. So I can't show my PowerPoint presentation(介绍) at the meeting tomorrow. Do I have to install a whole set of Office suite on it ?

Tony： Don't worry about that, Leo. If you package your presentation and copy it to the meeting room computer, you can play it without installing Microsoft Office.

Leo： Really ? Could you tell me how to do it in detail ?

Tony： OK, you can just follow my instructions. First, open your presentation in PowerPoint. Click Package for CD on the File menu.

Leo： OK. I already opened the Package for CD dialog box.

Tony： Click the Copy to Folder button. Specify(指定) the name and location(地点) of the destination(目的地) folder, and click OK.

Leo： I am prompted(提示) that the files are being copied to the folder.

Tony： Yeah. Close the Package for CD dialog box after it is done. You may copy the folder to the Computer. In the folder, you can find a program named ppt-view.exe Double-click to run this program.

Leo： OK. I think I should click the Accept button to continue using the application.

Tony： Yes. In the PowerPoint Viewer dialog box,select the presentation in the folder,and then click the Open button to run it. And, of course, you may burn(烧伤) the folder onto(v) a CD, which will be all your decision(决定).

Leo： Great ! I can never thank you enough for you help.

Tony： Don't mention it. It is not a big deal.
