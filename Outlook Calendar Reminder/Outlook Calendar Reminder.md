# Outlook Calendar Reminder

Tony： How are you doing, Leo ?

Leo： It's been awful(可怕) ! The manager got angry with me I forgot a very important appointment(约定，约会，约) with a client and kept him waiting for more than an hour, which almost drove(导致) the client crazy. Maybe, I really need a secretary(秘书) myself.

Tony： Come on, get real(醒醒吧) ! Why not use Microsoft Outlook Reminder(提醒) ?

Leo： Outlook Reminder ? I've never heard of it. What's that ? How can i use it ?

Tony： Reminder is a feature in Outlook Calendar. It could remind you about your appointments meetings, tasks, etc. First, run Microsoft Outlook and select Calendar on the Go menu.

Leo： Great ! But if I want repeat the reminding every week, for example for the appointment on every Wednesday, what should I do ?

Tony： Click New Recurring(定期) Appointment from the Actions menu. Under recurrence(循环) pattern(图案), set the interval(间隔) as Weekly and select Wednesday. Under Range of recurrence select a start date in the start list, and then select a stop time. Click OK.

Leo： Oh, I got it.

Tony： At last, in the Subject box(主题框) of the Untitled(无标题) -Appointment window, type(输入) a name for the reminder, and then click Save and Close.

Leo： That' s so cool, Tony !  You are always so helpful to me.

Tony： Don' t mention it.
