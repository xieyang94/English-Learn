# Outlook Calendar Reminder

Tony：How are you doing, Leo?

Leo：It's been awful! The manager got angry with me I forgot a very important appointment with a client and kept him waiting for more than an hour, which almost drove the client crazy. Maybe, I really need a secretary myself.

Tony：Come on, get real! Why not use Microsoft Outlook Reminder ?

Leo：Outlook Reminder? I’ve never heard of it. What's that? How can i use it?

Tony：Reminder is a feature in Outlook Calendar. It could remind you about your appointments meetings, tasks, etc. First, run Microsoft Out look and select Calendar on the Go menu.

Leo：Great ! But if I want repeat the reminding every week, for example for the appointment on every Wednesday, what should I do?

Tony：Click New Recurring Appointment from the Actions menu. Under recurrence pattern, set the interval as Weekly and select Wednesday. Under Range of recurrence select a start date in the start list, and then select a stop time. Click OK.

Leo：Oh, I got it.

Tony：At last, in the Subject box of the Untitled -Appointment window, type a name for the reminder, and then click Save and Close.

Leo：That' s so cool, Tony !  You are always so helpful to me.

Tony：Don' t mention it.
