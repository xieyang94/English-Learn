# Move My Documents To Another Location

Tony：I just remember something.Leo, where do you save your documents?

Leo：In My Documents.Why?

Tony：Did you ever move it to somewhere else?

Leo：No.Am I supposed to?

Tony：Well, then I suggest you move it to somewhere other than the C drive, the Primary partition.

Leo：Can I ask why? And if I need to, what should I do?

Tony：The folder is originally located in the C drive.When you format the drive and re-install your system in case of system failure, the documents in the folder will be lost.You know what I mean?

Leo：Yeah, you've made your point.What exactly should I do now?

Tony：Just right-click My Documents and select Properties.Click the Move button on the Target tab and choose the target folder location or you can create a new folder for it.

Leo：That seems easy.Thank you, Tony.I really appreciate your advice.

Tony：Anytime
