# Enable your firewall

Leo : Tony , I often hear the word “firewall”. Could you tell me what exactly it is ?

Tony : OK , no problem . Actually , a firewall is a software program or a hardware device that helps screen out hackers and malware ( Malicious software ) like viruses and worms that try to reach your computer over the network .

Leo : It seems very important to the computer system . Do I have a firewall in my Windows XP system ?

Tony : If you're running Windows XP Service Pack 2 ( SP2 ) , Windows firewall is built into the system and enabled by default . However , it might be turned off in some cases.

Leo : I see . What shall I do i my Windows Firewall is turned off

Tony : In that case , you ' d better follow these steps to enable your Windows Firewall:

1 . Go to Control Panel and enter Windows Security Center

2 . Click Windows Firewall

3 . Select On ( recommended )

Leo : got it But would you please tell me more about Windows Firewall For instance , how does it work ?

Tony : Since you are so interested in this, I’d like to tell you some more details . If you run a program such as an instant messaging program that needs to receive information from the network the firewall will ask if you want to keep blocking or unblock the connection.

You would see a dialogue box.

Leo : If I do want to use the program , I need to select Unblock , right?

Tony : Yes , if you choose to unblock the connection , Windows Firewall will create an exception so that the firewall won ' t bother you when that program needs to receive information in the future.

Leo : I see, Thank you so much

Tony : You are welcome
