# Use Skype to talk with others

Leo：Tony, have you ever used Skype ?

Tony：Yep. Why ?

Leo：My friend has recommended it to me. But i am not sure whether it is good or not.

Tony：I often talk to my fiends in America with Skype.

Leo：What are the features of it ?

Tony：Skype uses VOIP, that is, Voice over Internet Protocol.You can use it to communicate with others on the Internet. And you can also dial regular phone numbers in some areas.

Leo：Will it charge me if I use Skype?

Tony：Well, it depends. If you make PC to PC calls on the Internet. it is free But if you call a regular phone number, you will have to pay for it.

Leo：What about the call quality?

Tony：You can make a test call and leave a message after the " beep”, and then Skype will play your sound record. In this way, you can know the quality of your call.

Leo：Can I chat with several people at the same time ?

Tony：You can chat with several people at the same time by making a conference call or starting a group chat. But the latter one just allows you to chat by sending text messages.

Leo：Sounds great. I will give it a try sometime. Thank you, Tony.

Tony：My pleasure.
