# Google' Elite Security Team

When Apple Launched the iphone through an exclusive partnership with AT&T in 2007 , seventeen-year-old George Hotz wanted to use an iphone but not with AT&T. He wanted to make calls through his own T-Mobile network , so he cracked AT&T's lock on the iphone . Apple scrambled to fix the bug that allowed this , but officially ignored George Hotz.

Later in 2011 , Hotz reverse engineered  the PlayStation 3 and posted a copy of the root keys on his website . Sony sued him but settled after Hotz promised never to hack Sony products again

Then in the early 2014 , at Google‘s hacking competition , Hotz discovered a security hole in the Google's Chrome OS.
The company gave him a 150 000 reward. 

Two months later , Google's security engineer Chris Evans offered him a position in a team of elite hackers. George Hotz accepted the offer and now works for Google's security team Project Zero.
